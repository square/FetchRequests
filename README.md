# FetchRequests

FetchRequests is an eventing library inspired by NSFetchedResultsController and written in Swift.

- [x] Listen for live updates
- [x] Animate underlying data changes
- [x] Fetch associated values in batch
- [x] Support paginated requests
- [x] SwiftUI Integration
- [x] Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage

## Usage

FetchRequests can be used for any combination of networking, database, and file queries.
It is best when backed by something like a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) where you're expecting your data to live update.

To get started, you create a `FetchRequest` which explains your data access patterns.
The `FetchedResultsController` is the interface to access the your data.
It will automatically cache your associated values for the lifetime of that controller.
If a memory pressure event occurs, it will release its hold on those objects, allowing them to be de-inited.

The example app has an UserDefaults-backed storage mechanism.
The unit tests have in-memory objects, with NotificationCenter eventing.

Today, it is heavily dependent on the Obj-C runtime, as well as Key-Value Observation.
It should be possible to further remove those restrictions, and some effort has been made to remove them.

### SwiftUI

There are two SwiftUI Property Wrappers available for use, `FetchableRequest` and `SectionedFetchableRequest`. These are analagous to CoreData's property wrappers.

The controller will perform a fetch once and only once upon the first view render. After that point, it is dependent upon live update events.

Examples:

```swift
struct AllUsersView: View {
    @FetchableRequest(
        fetchDefinition: FetchDefinition(request: User.fetchAll),
        sortDescriptors: [
            NSSortDescriptor(
                key: #keyPath(User.name),
                ascending: true,
                selector: #selector(NSString.localizedStandardCompare)
            ),
        ]
    )
    private var members: FetchableResults<User>

    // ...
}
```

For more complicated use cases, you probably will need to write initializers for your view, for example:

```swift
struct MembersView: View {
    private let fromID: EntityID

    @FetchableRequest
    private var members: FetchableResults<Membership>

    func init(fromID: EntityID) {
        self.fromID = fromID
        _members = FetchableRequest(
            fetchDefinition: Membership.fetchDefinition(from: fromID, toEntityType: .user)
        )
    }

    // ...
}
```
